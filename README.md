# Intermodulation FMCW (IM-FMCW) Radar

System level simulation of an intermodulation FMCW (IM-FMCW) radar with [National Instruments (NI) AWR Visual System Simulator (VSS)](http://www.awrcorp.com/products/ni-awr-design-environment/visual-system-simulator).

This the simulation file for my paper:

**Z. Peng** and C. Li, “Intermodulation FMCW (IM-FMCW) Radar for Non-Linear Wearable Targets Detection”, in *United States National Committee of URSI National Radio Science Meeting (USNC-URSI NRSM)*, Boulder, CO, Jan. 4-7, 2018.
